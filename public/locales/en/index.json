For example, if the user bets on the price of BTC to rise at one point at $35,001 and the round finishes with BTC at $35,002, the user wins. If the user bets on BTC to rise at $35,001, then again to rise at $35,005, but the round finishes at $35,003, then the user will win the first bet but lose the second bet. Alternatively, if the user bets on BTC to fall at $35,001, and also to fall at $35,005, but the round finishes at $35,003, then the user will lose the first bet but win the second bet.",
  "faq_content_2": "2. The winner will be rewarded according to the displayed times. For the last 20 seconds of the one-minute round, the user cannot bet. The odds which the user bets on the price may fluctuate. For instance, at one time they may be 1.95 (so if a user bets at $10 and wins, he wins $19.50), but at another time may be 1.92 (so if a user bet at $10 and wins, he wins $19.20).",
